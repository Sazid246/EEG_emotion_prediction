ðŸ§  EEG Signal Analysis & Classification
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and processing Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. It includes preprocessing techniques, feature extraction, and classification methods to analyze brainwave activity for various applications.

ðŸš€ Features:
EEG Data Preprocessing: Noise removal, filtering, and normalization
Feature Extraction: Time-domain, frequency-domain, and machine learning-based feature selection
Classification & Prediction: Machine learning models (e.g., SVM, CNN, LSTM) for EEG pattern recognition
Visualization: EEG signal plots, spectrograms, and statistical insights
ðŸ“Œ Applications:
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)
Cognitive state analysis
Sleep stage classification
Epilepsy and neurological disorder detection
ðŸ”— Getting Started: Clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the notebook to explore EEG signal processing and classification.
